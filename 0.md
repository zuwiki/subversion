The plaza was packed. Everyone wanted to see the man in white. There was talk that even the Administrators don't know his identity. It was probably nothing more than wild rumors, but it had been suggested that the man in white planned to persuade the Administrators to open up the inner tier to migrants. After years of strife in the outer tiers&mdash;disease, famine, chaos&mdash;the only people who weren't scratching day and night at the doors of the inner tier were drug traffickers and hippies living in communes as far from the city as possible. It was rumored there were even some communes on the coastâ€”the mystical border where dirt meets sea, ruin meets tranquility, and the hell of America meets the heaven of Atlantis.

Residents of the inner tier knew no sea, or even sky. Inside the inner tier there was only the dome over the inner tier and whatever virtual environment was broadcast on the millions of screens covering its underside. So when the man in white appeared on these screens, it was hard not to listen to him. His baritone voice gently assured the populace that there was no malfunction, no error&mdash;only change. He told them to gather in the dome's eastern plaza on December third at precisely noon.

Noon on December third was three minutes away as Eliot skulked through the crowd. He was as curious as anyone. What kind of change could the man in white even be talking about? Political activists had been rather consistently exiled by the Administrators. His parents had long taught Eliot that peace generally required the populace to surrender many of their freedoms and submit to whatever the ruling body imposed. Reading the newspaper, Eliot's father would often comment on the political section: "Exactly what Jefferson had in mind..." This bit of sarcasm was his only form of political resistance. Of course, most people did not know who Jefferson was, as Eliot's father often dejectedly pointed out.

Eliot was not surprised by the abnormally strong presence of law enforcement in the plaza. However, the armored mechanical units that had been slowly streaming in for the last few minutes was somewhat alarming. In any case, it was obvious that the vast majority of the inner tier's citizens had assembled in the plaza. The eastern plaza, the second largest of the dome's three plazas, could hold approximately a third of the inner tier's population, and it was teeming. Why hadn't they chosen the northern plaza, which had room for at least half again as many people? In the center, a crude stage had been erected with three speaker columns connected with thick black beams forming a triangle at the top, and another at the midpoint. The setup was at least a hundred feet tall. Were the Administrators truly going to allow this to continue?

Two minutes to go. Eliot never did well in crowds. He would probably be able to hear from much further away than his current position about halfway between the central stage and the edge of the plaza, so Eliot decided to ease toward the western edge. As he was turning, he heard an explosion and screams erupting all around him. Jerking his head from left to right, he spied the site of the explosion on the northern side of the plaza near the edge. Gunfire flared from the police's nearby armored units. It was probably a good idea to be leaving.

Swiveling around once more to the west, Eliot's eyes passed over the eastern side of the plaza just in time to see an explosion many times larger than the first. Now he pushed. Everyone else pushed. They were all trying to get away. Then he realized why they had chosen the eastern plaza. It was right along the edge of the dome. The explosion had probably breached it. Eliot turned his head back to check. Indeed, he could see sunlight, real natural sunlight pouring through the fresh wound.
