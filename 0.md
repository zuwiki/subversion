The plaza was packed. Everyone wanted to see the man in white. There was talk that even the Administrators don't know his identity. It was probably nothing more than wild rumors, but it had been suggested that the man in white planned to persuade the Administrators to open up the inner tier to migrants. After years of strife in the outer tiers—disease, famine, chaos—the only people who weren't scratching day and night at the doors of the inner tier were drug traffickers and hippies living in communes as far from the city as possible. It was rumored there were even some communes on the coast—the mystical border where dirt meets sea, ruin meets tranquility, and the hell of America meets the heaven of Atlantis.

Residents of the inner tier knew no sea, or even sky. Inside the inner tier there was only the dome over the inner tier and whatever virtual environment was broadcast on the millions of screens covering its underside. So when the man in white appeared on these screens, it was hard not to listen to him. His baratone voice gently assured the populace that there was no malfunction, no error&mdash;only change. He told them to gather in the dome's eastern plaza on December third at precisely noon.
