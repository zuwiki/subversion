The real reason Eliot picked up his pace was that the man's more mentally matured friend was demanding Eliot's wallet. Judging by their clothes, they probably couldn't afford guns. Knives could be a problem though.
Stepping onto the street, Eliot saw his breath against the black sky as he passed under the light of a street lamp. Morose public workers had been working on the street all month, and now there was a light scattering of gravel near the sides of the street. It cracked as Eliot's foot came down on the asphalt. Halfway across the street, he glanced behind himself. They pursued languidly, still shouting their insults, which rang down the empty street.
Eliot didn't know where he was going. He had been sleeping on the cold streets since his parents had started on the D again.
