Eliot picked up his pace. They probably knew it had been him. Of course they knew, was anyone else walking in the opposite direction of their enclave in these empty streets? In any case, they weren't following very quickly. He could probably outrun them.
Stepping onto the street, Eliot saw his breath against the black sky as he passed under the light of a passing helicopter. There was a light scattering of gravel near the sides of the street which cracked as Eliot's foot came down on the asphalt. Halfway across the street, he glanced behind himself. They pursued languidly, still shouting their insults, which rang down the empty street.
"Give up that loaf 'fore we kill you, fucka."
He might be able to outtrun them, but Eliot didn't know where he was going. He had only been in the outher city a few days.
